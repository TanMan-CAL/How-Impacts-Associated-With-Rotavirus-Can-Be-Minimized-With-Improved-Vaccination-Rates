# How Government-Funded Initiatives Focused On Combating Rotavirus Can Better Save Lives By Improving Rotavirus Vaccination Rates

Rotavirus causes many symptoms in children: vomiting, fever, fatigue, and abdominal pain. However, the most serious and deadly of these are diarrhea and dehydration (https://www.cdc.gov/rotavirus/vaccination.html). It is these that most commonly cause children to die. But it is important to note that a lot of people become infected by rotavirus, but experience mild or moderate symptoms; some people do not show any symptoms at all, which makes tracking the virus and its growth even harder. The virus can spread through germs found in feces, which then contaminates food, water, and even surfaces and the air. From this, we can infer that poor hygiene practices and water safety and hygiene systems (WASH systems) contribute to the high number of rotavirus cases and deaths, especially when we consider that Africa still falls behind the developed world in WASH systems (https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-4-active-vaccines/page-19-rotavirus-vaccine.html). People still have to use one source of water for nearly all of their needs (and even these lakes/rivers are usually very far from where they live), which is what leads to this contamination.
With definitions of rotavirus and how it kills people established, one now needs to understand the socioeconomic factors studied to gain a better idea of exactly how we wish to study rotavirus data.

Our team used the computer language R and the IDE RStudio to run tests, calculate means and medians, filter data, and assess variance, along with Excel to manage and alter the datasets. The datasets primarily used to find the correlation of socioeconomic factors included the rotavirus vaccination rates (% of individuals with the rotavirus vaccines within each country), rotavirus mortality rates (rotavirus mortality rates per one-hundred thousand individuals in each country), healthcare spending expenditure (% of GDP spent on government-funded healthcare within each country), HDI (a number between 0.000 - 1.000, assessing success within a country in core elements of human development), and lastly, GNI per capita (international dollars using PPP rates defining an economyâ€™s generated profit). And of course, the primary focus of the study was kept on the Sub-Saharan-African region, and therefore, the datasets were exclusive to only twenty-four countries. 

With our research, the study aim to confirm a correlation between the vaccination rates for rotavirus and the deaths caused due to rotavirus. In addition to this, socioeconomic factors that may affect this correlation were identified. The goal is to evaluate these factors for Sub-Saharan countries as it isolates correlating factors to mortality rates which can be used for countries to improve upon them.
