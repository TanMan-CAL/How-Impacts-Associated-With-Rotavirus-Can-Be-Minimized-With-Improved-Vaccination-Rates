Stress is a pervasive experience for a considerable number of individuals, including expecting mothers. In fact, pregnancy can be an especially demanding period for women as they navigate the physical, emotional, and social transitions that come with nurturing a new life. Findings from research indicate that a significant percentage of pregnant women, ranging from 10-20%, experience depression symptoms during gestation, while up to 25% report anxiety symptoms (Catherine Lebel, Anna MacKinnon, Mercedes Bagshawe, Lianne Tomfohr-Madsen, and Gerald Giesbrecht). 

Alongside statistics, further investigating the impact of maternal stress on the offspring's immune response systems, this study employed a dataset of interleukin cytokine concentrations (pg/mL or pg/ug total protein)  in the offspring of pregnant mice from an experiment conducted by the University of Iowa. In the experiment, mice were divided into two groups. Group 1 was exposed to varying degrees of thermal stress periodically, while group 2 was not subjected to any stress. Upon birthing, tissues were collected, and the cytokine concentrations were calculated in the following parts of the mother mice and offspring: maternal serum, forebrain, and placenta, across both groups. As the primary objective of the study was to investigate the relationship between mean cytokine concentrations and stress levels, six individual interleukin cytokines: IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17 were used for evaluation. Using the R programming language, statistical analyses were utilized to compare mean cytokine concentrations in pregnant mice that were exposed to prenatal stress versus those that were not. 

Specifically, the following tests used were the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, the Levene's test, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Based on the statistical analyses conducted, a correlation was observed between the levels of stress and the mean cytokine concentrations. he analysis revealed significant differences in the cytokine concentrations between group 1 and group 2 for four out of the six interleukins examined. Our analysis revealed a significant relationship between the interleukin cytokines present in offspring and the prenatal stress experienced by their mother. 

Potential for our findings suggests that stress triggers the release of cortisol, which can suppress the production of white blood cells, leading to an increase in the activity of interleukin cytokines. Thus, our study provides valuable insight into how maternal prenatal stress can affect the cytokine concentrations in offspring and suggests that interventions to reduce maternal stress levels may have a positive impact on fetal development. In addition, the dataset used in this study was limited due to several factors, including the use of pregnant mice, a lack of separation between male and female offspring, and the testing of different sample types.  Future studies should aim to use human subjects to provide more relevant information about the impact of maternal prenatal stress on cytokine levels in offspring. Such studies could yield valuable insights into how to mitigate the negative effects of prenatal stress on fetal development and improve overall human health.
